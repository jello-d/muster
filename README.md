# muster

Keeping many repos coherent enough to reason about.

A muster is the act of assembling a set and verifying each member is present
and correct. That is this tool's whole job, and "pass muster" is the other
half of it.

## The problem

Work spread across many small repos, on more than one machine, with shared
development standards vendored into each one, produces a class of failure
that is individually trivial and collectively expensive: every answer you
have about the set is slightly out of date, and nothing tells you which.

Each repo knows itself. Each machine knows its own checkouts. Nothing knows
the set. So:

- a checkout can be commits behind while `git status` says it is current,
  because the ref it compares against is itself stale
- a package installed from a moving pin has a dev checkout, a deployed
  clone and an origin, and all three can disagree
- a shared file vendored into fifteen repos drifts fifteen ways
- a verification that takes half an hour can be invalidated, silently, by
  someone else's commit while it runs

Every one of those is a stale read or a stale write.

## What it does

Two halves, deliberately split by what they need to run:

**Survey**, the diagnostic half: what state is this set of repos actually
in. Pure POSIX shell, no network required, no virtualenv, because this is
reached for precisely when something is broken and that is when a heavy
dependency is least likely to be there.

**Reconcile**, the mutating half: make a shared artifact agree across the
set, asynchronously, without blocking any repo. May depend on real tools,
because mutating work can demand them.

Diagnose with nothing, repair with tools.

## What it is not

- Not a release coordinator. A verification that outlives its tree needs a
  freeze, which is a human decision; the tool's job is to say the result
  is void.
- Not a monorepo emulator. It does not build, publish or version anything.
- It knows nothing about who is calling it.
- It does not enforce access boundaries. Where a kernel-level boundary
  exists, that boundary is the enforcement, and a tool honouring it by
  convention would be a soft rule standing where a hard one already is.

## Status

Specified, not yet implemented. `docs/requirements.md` carries the
requirements, each one anchored to an incident rather than to a
hypothetical, and a survey of the existing tools that already solve most of
this. Read that before writing anything: the most useful conclusion in it
is how much of this should be adopted rather than built.
